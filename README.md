# DevOps Agent Docker Image

## Overview

This repository contains a Dockerfile for creating a versatile DevOps agent Docker image. This image is designed to provide a development and CI/CD environment with essential tools for DevOps workflows, including Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform CLI.

## Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` in this repository builds an image that incorporates the following tools:

- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy applications. It supports continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Ansible**: An open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code.
- **Terraform CLI**: An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It provides infrastructure as code capabilities to manage cloud and on-premises resources.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Jenkins**: Easily run Jenkins to manage your CI/CD pipelines directly from the container.
- **Ansible Integration**: Execute Ansible playbooks to automate configuration and deployment tasks.
- **Terraform Support**: Use Terraform to define and provision infrastructure within the container.

## Usage

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t devops-agent .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name devops-agent-container devops-agent
   ```

3. **Access Jenkins:**
   Jenkins will be accessible via the container's exposed port. Check the container logs for the initial admin password and URL.

4. **Use Ansible and Terraform:**
   Inside the running container, you can execute Ansible and Terraform commands as needed. 

## Example Workflow

Here’s an example of a typical workflow using this Docker image:

1. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Define your CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
   - Configure Jenkins to use Ansible and Terraform as needed.

2. **Automate Configuration with Ansible:**
   - Write Ansible playbooks for configuration management.
   - Execute these playbooks within the Jenkins pipeline or directly inside the container.

3. **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform:**
   - Define your infrastructure as code using Terraform.
   - Run Terraform commands within the container to manage your infrastructure.
